# CSCI-212---Machine-Organization-and-Assembly-Language
This is my work for CSCI 212 at Palomar College


This course was an introduction to Assembly Language programming. Language syntax was covered, together with a study of the instruction set mnemonics, segment, index, pointer, general purpose and flag registers. A variety of memory addressing techniques were covered, as well as stack operations, particularly those associated with passing parameters to subroutine calls. Also includes I/O to screen, printer, and disk interfaces. Emphasis was placed on interaction between the student’s code and the operating system’s supplied functions for I/O to peripheral devices. Use of editor and debugging tools was also addressed.
